    <h1>Horizon Candy Theme for GitKraken</h1>
    <p>This is a port of the popular <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Henriquehnnm.horizon-candy" target="_blank">Horizon Candy</a> theme for the GitKraken client. The theme has been adapted to the GitKraken custom theme format, keeping the characteristic color palette in two variations: <b>Candy (Dark)</b> and <b>Milk (Light)</b>.</p>

    <h2>Available Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Candy</b>: The dark and vibrant version, ideal for those who prefer to code in low-light environments.</li>
      <li><b>Milk</b>: The light version, perfect for daytime use, with soft colors and high contrast.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Install</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Download the <code>.jsonc</code> file of the theme variation you wish to use (e.g., <code>horizon-candy-milk.jsonc</code>).</li>
      <li>Open GitKraken.</li>
      <li>Go to <b>Preferences &gt; UI Customization &gt; Theme</b>.</li>
      <li>Click the <b>Open Theme Folder</b> link to open the directory where custom themes are stored.</li>
      <li>Copy the downloaded <code>.jsonc</code> file to this folder.</li>
      <li>Return to GitKraken and select the <b>Horizon Candy</b> theme (or the name you gave the theme) from the list of available themes.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The theme will be applied immediately. If the theme does not appear, verify that the <code>.jsonc</code> file was saved with valid JSONC formatting and restart GitKraken.</p>
