# Horizon Candy Theme for GitKraken

This is a port of the popular [Horizon Candy](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Henriquehnnm.horizon-candy) theme for the GitKraken client. The theme has been adapted to the GitKraken custom theme format, keeping the characteristic color palette in two variations: **Candy (Dark)** and **Milk (Light)**.

## Available Variations

* **Candy**: The dark and vibrant version, ideal for those who prefer to code in low-light environments.
* **Milk**: The light version, perfect for daytime use, with soft colors and high contrast.

## How to Install

1. Download the `.jsonc` file of the theme variation you wish to use (e.g., `horizon-candy-milk.jsonc`).
2. Open GitKraken.
3. Go to **Preferences > UI Customization > Theme**.
4. Click the **Open Theme Folder** link to open the directory where custom themes are stored.
5. Copy the downloaded `.jsonc` file to this folder.
6. Return to GitKraken and select the **Horizon Candy** theme (or the name you gave the theme) from the list of available themes.

The theme will be applied immediately. If the theme does not appear, verify that the `.jsonc` file was saved with valid JSONC formatting and restart GitKraken.
